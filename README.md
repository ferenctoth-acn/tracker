# Introduction

This code is intended to be used with a Particle Electron board and a PAM-7Q module GPS module, plus an ADXL345 accelerometer board to allow the GPS to be powered down when there is no motion.  It publishes data to the Particle cloud, which is then web-hooked on to the Azure cloud (for Accenture to analyse).
