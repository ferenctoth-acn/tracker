# Introduction

This code is intended to be used with a Particle Electron board and a PAM-7Q GPS module, plus an ADXL345 accelerometer board (http://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/adxl345-breakout) to allow the GPS module to be powered-down when there is no motion.  It publishes data to the Particle cloud, which can then web-hooked on to the Azure cloud, or other clouds, for analysis.
